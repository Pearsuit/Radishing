## Synopsis

This app allows the user to register an account, with an optional profile picture, and upload and delete food recipes from the cloud. The user can pick a food photo from either their library or get a placeholder through an online search.

A text file titled AppFlow in the Documentation folder will given a more thorough walkthrough of the app.

## App Architecture

The app uses a personally-created enum oriented variant of Clean Architecture that uses a unidirectional ViewController-Allocator-Producer-Presenter flow so as to follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

Furthermore, the architecture uses extensive use of protocols and generics with protocol constraints to best conform to SOLID principles, as well as for better reusability, scalability, and refactoring. 

Please look at the App Architecture text file in the Documentation folder for more information on the architecture.
